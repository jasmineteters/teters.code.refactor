This assignment we were tasked to make an example webpage more efficient for search engine optimization as well as accessability for different browsers or users with disabilities. 

To do this, we needed to fix a link, add 'alt' descriptions to the site, and organize the code with more descriptive names than 'div'. 

We also needed to organize the css that was jumbled in a crazy, hard to read order, so to clean up the code, I ordered it by layout of the page.
